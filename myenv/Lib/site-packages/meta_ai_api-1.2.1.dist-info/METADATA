# MetaAI API Wrapper

MetaAI is a Python library designed to interact with Meta's AI APIs that run in the backend of https://www.meta.ai/. It encapsulates the complexities of authentication and communication with the APIs, providing a straightforward interface for sending queries and receiving responses.

With this you can easily prompt the AI with a message and get a response, directly from your Python code. **NO API KEY REQUIRED**

**Meta AI is connected to the internet, so you will be able to get the latest real-time responses from the AI.** (powered by Bing)

Meta AI is running Llama 3 LLM.

## Features
- **Prompt AI**: Send a message to the AI and get a response from Llama 3.
- **Image Generation**: Generate images using the AI. (Only for FB authenticated users)
- **Get Up To Date Information**: Get the latest information from the AI thanks to its connection to the internet.
- **Get Sources**: Get the sources of the information provided by the AI.
- **Streaming**: Stream the AI's response in real-time or get the final response.
- **Follow Conversations**: Start a new conversation or follow up on an existing one.

## Usage
**Download**:

   ```bash
   pip install meta-ai-api
   ```
   
**Initialization**:

```python
from meta_ai_api import MetaAI

ai = MetaAI()
response = ai.prompt(message="Whats the weather in San Francisco today? And what is the date?")
print(response)
 
```
```json
{
   "message":"The weather in San Francisco today is mostly clear to overcast, with no precipitation, a wind speed between 0 and 8 miles per hour and temperatures ranging from 51 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit ¹. The date is Friday, April 19, 2024 ². Please note that the weather forecast is continually changing ³ ⁴ ⁵ ⁶.\n",

### Follow conversations:
```python
```python
meta = MetaAI()

print(meta.prompt("what is 2 + 2?"))
print(meta.prompt("what was my previous question?"))
```

```
{'message': '2 + 2 = 4\n', 'sources': [], 'media': []}
{'message': 'Your previous question was "what is 2 + 2?"\n', 'sources': [], 'media': []}
```

And to start a new one:
```python
meta = MetaAI()

print(meta.prompt("what is 2 + 2?"))
print(meta.prompt("what was my previous question?", new_conversation=True))
```

```
{'message': '2 + 2 = 4\n', 'sources': [], 'media': []}
{'message': "This is the beginning of our conversation, so I don't have a previous question to refer to. I'm happy to chat with you, though! What's on your mind today?\n", 'sources': [], 'media': []}
```

---
```python
from meta_ai_api import MetaAI

ai = MetaAI()
response = ai.prompt(message="What was the Warriors score last game?")
print(response)
```
```json
{
   "message":"The Golden State Warriors' last game was against the Sacramento Kings, and they lost 118-94 ¹ ². Stephen Curry scored 22 points, and the Kings' win eliminated the Warriors from the playoffs ³. The Warriors finished the season 46-36 and 10th in the Western Conference ⁴ ³.\n",
   "sources":[
      {
         "link":"https://sportradar.com/",
         "title":"Game Info of NBA from sportradar.com"
      },

         "title":"History of the Golden State Warriors"
      }
   ]
}
```

**Using proxy**:

```python
from meta_ai_api import MetaAI

proxy = {
    'http': 'http://proxy_address:port',
    'https': 'https://proxy_address:port'
}

ai = MetaAI(proxy=proxy)
response = ai.prompt(message="How to find out which mushrooms are edible?")
print(response)
```

**Streaming Response**:

```python
from meta_ai_api import MetaAI

ai = MetaAI()
response = ai.prompt(message="What was the Warriors score last game?", stream=True)
for r in response:
    print(r)
```

```

```

**Generate Image**:

By default image generation is only available for FB authenticated users. If you go on https://www.meta.ai/ , and ask the AI to generate an image, you will be prompted to authenticate with Facebook.
So if you want to generate images using this library, you need to authenticate using your FB credentials.

**Note**: There seems to be higher rate limits for authenticated users. So only authenticate to generate images.

```python
from meta_ai_api import MetaAI
ai = MetaAI(fb_email="your_fb_email", fb_password="your_fb_password")
resp = ai.prompt(message="Generate an image of a tech CEO")
print(resp)
```
